## Study of the influence of actors network on their career evolution

How do actors become famous ? Is it only thanks to their skills ? Did their career explode once they played with an actor whose movies are already well recieved by the critics ? In this study, we aim to assess whether there is a link between an actor's network and his "score", where an actor score is characterized by the mean of the movie ratings he played in. For the purpose of our investigation, we construct a graph that can change over time, where nodes are actors and edges represent the fact that two actors play in a movie together. We study around 40 000 movies taken from [CMU Movie Summary Corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/), and use an additional dataset taken from [IMDb](https://datasets.imdbws.com/) in order to get the ratings of those movies. We study the actor's network evolution from 1985 to 2008, and analyze the interactions between the actors. 

## Why movie ratings as an actor "success" scale ? 

We wanted to find a way to quantify how much an actor is successful in his carreer. We decided that a successful actor is an actor that plays in movies considered good by the public, which can be assessed thanks to the movie ratings. Then, an actor "success" is defined as the weighted average of their precedent movies, and the current one.
