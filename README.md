# Networking, a key to success in the movie industry ?

## Study of the influence of actor's network on their career evolution

How do actors become famous? Is it only thanks to their talent, or did they follow a certain pattern? Did their career explode once they played with a well known actor? In this study, we aim to assess whether there is a link between an actor's network and his "score", where an actor score is characterized by the mean of the movie ratings he played in. For the purpose of our investigation, we construct a graph that can change over time, where nodes are actors and edges represent the fact that two actors play in a movie together. We study around 40 000 movies taken from [CMU Movie Summary Corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/) We use an additional dataset taken from [IMDb](https://datasets.imdbws.com/), in order to get the ratings of those movies. 1985 to 2008
